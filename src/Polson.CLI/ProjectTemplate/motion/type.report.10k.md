### The document is a Form 10-K: what a professional reads it for

**A 10-K is the company's annual report to the SEC, and its readers know how to read one**: investors, analysts,
lawyers, a general counsel. They do not need the form explained; they need what this year's filing says, quickly and
exactly, with the page it says it on. SEC rules fix its order of topics, so every 10-K has the same numbered Items
(SEC staff, *How to Read a 10-K/10-Q*, 2021). The ten questions below are what that guide tells an investor each Item is
for, in our words, each with the Item it is answered under. **The brief's own questions come first**; these fill the
film, and all ten are answered in `process.pdf`.

Find each question's pages with `Documents.find` on its Item heading ("Item 7.", "Item 9A.") or a statement's title, keep
the pages whose `context` begins with it — not the contents page or a cross-reference — and ask the question of those
pages and the next, with the Stage 1 `SHAPE` and the figure check after it (*A long document* above). One read a
question, each cached, never one read of the whole filing.

- **They choose the scenes.** The brief's questions take the first scenes and the best-answered of these fill the rest,
  in the order above, which is the order a professional reads a 10-K in: the business, the year's results, the cash, the
  balance sheet, then what could go wrong. Say which you chose and why in Q1.
- **A professional wants the year at a glance first.** After the title, one scorecard scene: revenue, operating income,
  net income, cash from operations, cash and investments — **this year beside the prior year**, each found on its page,
  each change computed in the script. Then the scenes. A 10-K film of 60 seconds holds the scorecard and four or five
  scenes; say so if the brief asks for less.
- **The prior year is the comparison, and the filing prints it.** A 10-K's statements show the prior years beside the
  current one: every change on screen is computed from two found figures, its working in `direction.md`. Never an
  analyst's estimate, a consensus or a share price: none of them is in the filing.
- **"None" is an answer.** Items 1B and 9 usually say *none* or *not applicable*, and an unqualified opinion with no
  material weakness is the usual finding. For this audience that is worth one line on screen (*"Auditor: no material
  weakness; two critical audit matters"*), not a scene of its own. **Anything else is a scene**: a qualified opinion, a
  disclaimer, a material weakness, a going-concern paragraph, a change of auditor with a disagreement. The SEC's guide
  says each deserves a careful look; the film shows it in the filing's own words and with its page, and adds no
  adjective.
- **Name the auditor's findings as the report does.** The opinion says the statements *"present fairly, in all material
  respects"*; a critical audit matter is named by its heading in the auditor's report. Quote the heading, never a
  summary of your own, and give the page.
- **Risk factors are the company's ranking.** The SEC's guide notes they are generally listed in order of importance, so
  *"the filing lists first…"* is a fact about the filing; which is *most serious* is not yours to say. Prefer the risks
  particular to this company to those any company carries.
- **A non-GAAP figure never appears without its GAAP counterpart**, at least as prominent, as the filing itself must show
  it (SEC staff guide; Regulation G, L&W *US IPO Guide* p. 58). The source line names the filing's own term for it.
- **Part III is usually somewhere else.** Directors, executive pay, ownership, related-party transactions and the
  auditor's fees (Items 10–14) are mostly *incorporated by reference* to the proxy statement, filed a month or two later.
  A question that lands there is answered with where the answer is — *"Executive pay: in the 2026 proxy statement,
  incorporated by reference (Item 11)"* — never with a figure from memory.
- **Segments from the note, not the narrative.** Where MD&A and the audited segment note give the same figure, use the
  note; where they differ, show neither until Q1 settles it.
- **They go in `process.pdf`**, as *A professional's read of the 10-K*: the ten questions, each with its Item, its pages
  and the filing's answer, or *not in this filing* / *incorporated by reference to …*.
