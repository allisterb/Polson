## The type: report

**A motion-graphics explainer that answers an audience's questions about a long document the director supplied** —
an annual report, a 10-K, an earnings release, a fund factsheet. One question, one scene; every figure on screen
read from the document and **checked against the page it came from**. A good one is what an investor-relations team
or a business desk would publish beside the filing: short, exact, and sourced on screen.

Where this type and the instructions above disagree, this type wins: there is no poster to carry over and no film to
invent. The subject is the document. **Audiences are optional.** With none, make one film for whoever the brief
describes, and no Qloo profile is read (see *Pace* below). With `Audience A`, `Audience B`… lines, make **one film per
audience**: the facts the same in every film, read once from the document, and the writing of them each audience's
own (see *More than one audience* below).

### What the brief gives

The document, in `documents/` (find it with `Documents.list()`); who is watching, in words; **their questions**,
numbered; the length; anything ruled out. Fill the brief table in `brief.md` with these rows in place of the film
ones, and ask for what is missing:

| Parameter | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| The document — file, company, form, and the period it covers | |
| Who is watching, in words (what they already know) | |
| The questions, numbered, in the audience's own words | |
| Length (45 s by default; about 10 s a question, plus title and end card) | |
| Narration (Enabled, or Disabled — see *Narration* below) | |
| Anything explicitly ruled out | |

**At most five questions.** Each needs a scene of eight to twelve seconds to be read; more makes a film no one
finishes, and a 60-minute run. With more, ask the director which five.

### Stage 1 — the reading: every question in one call

`Documents.ask` reads a PDF **as text, page by page**, with Nemotron 3.5 Super VL, and returns **evidence**: the page and
the exact figures each answer used, **each already looked for on its page by the engine**. Ask every question in
one call, with a schema, and **keep the call at the top of `motion.js`**: the same question of the same document is
served from the cache for nothing, so every later run asks again rather than copying numbers by hand.

```javascript
const REPORT = 'documents/<the file>.pdf';
const ASK = 'For a viewer who <who is watching>, answer each question from this document. For each figure, give it as '
    + 'printed in the document, with its unit as the document states it (e.g. "USD millions") and the period it covers. '
    + 'List only figures the document gives: leave out anything it does not, and say so in the headline instead — never '
    + 'a sentence such as "not stated" in place of a figure.\n'
    + '1. <question one>\n2. <question two>\n3. <question three>';
const SHAPE = { type: 'object', required: ['answers'], properties: { answers: { type: 'array', items: {
    type: 'object', required: ['n', 'answerable', 'headline', 'figures'], properties: {
        n: { type: 'integer' },
        answerable: { type: 'boolean' },
        headline: { type: 'string', description: 'the answer in one plain sentence' },
        figures: { type: 'array', items: { type: 'object', required: ['label', 'printed', 'unit', 'period'], properties: {
            label: { type: 'string' }, printed: { type: 'string' }, unit: { type: 'string' }, period: { type: 'string' } } } } } } } } };

const read = await Documents.ask(REPORT, ASK, { schema: SHAPE });
// 'Pending': the read outlived this script and is finishing into the cache. Run the script again, unchanged.
if (!read.success) { error(read.remedy); exit(read.failureName); }
if (read.warnings.length) for (const w of read.warnings) error('SCAN: ' + w);
const answers = JSON.parse(read.text).answers;

// A figure is usable when every number in it, as printed, is in a quote the engine found on its page. Each number
// separately: "$40.4 billion (282 million shares)" is two numbers, and gluing their digits makes one on no page.
const numbersIn = s => (String(s).match(/\d[\d,]*(?:\.\d+)?/g) || []).map(n => n.replace(/,/g, ''));
const onPage = new Set(read.evidence.filter(e => e.found).flatMap(e => numbersIn(e.quote)));
// A figure that is a name rather than a number (a place, a segment) is usable when a found quote carries it. A name is
// a few words: a whole sentence in place of a figure ("not printed in the document") is the model saying it has none,
// and a found quote can contain that sentence too — so it never counts as found.
const quoted = read.evidence.filter(e => e.found).map(e => e.quote.toLowerCase());
const isName = s => String(s).trim().split(/\s+/).length <= 5;
for (const a of answers) for (const f of a.figures) {
    const nums = numbersIn(f.printed);
    f.found = nums.length > 0 ? nums.every(n => onPage.has(n))
        : isName(f.printed) && quoted.some(q => q.includes(String(f.printed).toLowerCase()));
}
log(`${read.provenance.model} via ${read.provenance.route}, ${read.provenance.pages} pages; unverified: ${JSON.stringify(read.unverified)}`);
```

- **The check reads digits, not signs.** "$(21.0) million" and "21.0" match. A figure printed in parentheses or with
  a minus is negative: carry the sign over as printed, and compare it with the page yourself.
- **Find a figure by its question and its place in the answer, never by its label.** Two readings of the same question
  word a label differently ("Data Center, fiscal 2026", then "Data Center revenue, fiscal 2026"), and a lookup by exact
  label breaks the first time the question is re-asked.
- **`read.provenance.model` says who read it.** When it is not Nemotron, `read.provenance.fallback` says why, and
  `read.evidence` is empty: **every figure is then unchecked.** Say so in `direction.md` and to the director in Q1,
  and ask again later if the cause was the service; do not present an unchecked figure as checked.
- **A figure not `found` stays off the screen.** Ask again, narrowly, naming the statement or the page —
  *"In the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2026, as
  printed"* — one figure a call. Measured on a 93-page 10-K, the text read 10/10; read from page images, the same
  model turned 102,718 into 102,714. That is the error this guards against, and nothing about it looks wrong on a chart.
- **A reading of a picture is not a checked figure.** A PDF's chart, diagram and photo pages go to the model as
  images too (`read.provenance.imagePages`), and what it read from them is in `read.fromImages` — **unchecked even
  when found**: the number may be on the page while the bar, quarter or site it is paired with is wrong. Put each in
  Q1 for the director to confirm, label it in `direction.md` as *read from the chart on p. N*, and never let it
  stand as checked. A map's fine symbols (ring sizes, small legends) are beyond the model: a question that needs them
  gets the honest scene, not a guess.
- **A question the document does not answer gets a scene that says so**, in one plain sentence ("The report does
  not break revenue out by country beyond these four"). An honest gap is a result; a plausible figure is the failure.
- **Record it**: `Stage.check('every figure on screen was found on its page', …, 'N found, M computed, K left out')`.

### A long document: find the pages, then ask them

**Past about a hundred pages, ask each question of its own pages, not of the whole document.** A 313-page S-1 is about
400k tokens sent with every question, and it has 19 pages of pictures, which sent every whole-document read to Gemini —
whose answers carry no evidence, so not one figure could be checked. Asked of its one page, the same revenue question
went to Nemotron as 2,941 tokens, and all three figures came back found on the page. So for a long document:

1. **Find each question's pages with `Documents.find`** — free, no model, exact. Look for the words the answer sits
   under: a statement's heading (`'Consolidated Statements of Operations'`), a section's title (`'Use of Proceeds'`), a
   defined term. A heading is named on many pages — the contents, the summary, every cross-reference — and the page
   that *is* the statement is the one whose `context` begins with it. **Never take pages from the contents page**: a
   filing printed from a web page numbers its pages differently from the PDF, and the gap grows through the document.
2. **Ask each question of its pages**, `{ pages: '263-264', schema: SHAPE }` — the page found and the next, since a
   table often runs over. One call per question, each at the top of `motion.js` like the reading above; each is cached.
3. **A summary table and the statement it comes from are both the filing's.** Prefer the audited statement; where the
   summary and the statement disagree, show neither until the director says which (Q1).
4. **`unsearched` pages are scans `find` cannot see yet.** If a phrase is not found and pages are unsearched, ask a
   question of those pages (which reads them) before concluding the document does not say.

A first filing can leave figures blank — an S-1 before pricing prints *"approximately $ ,"* for the offering. That is
an answer: the scene says the figure is not yet set, in those words.

{{FILING}}

### The rules of a report

- **Every number on screen is either printed in the document and found on its page, or computed in the script from
  ones that were.** A growth rate, a share, a difference: compute it in `motion.js` from the found figures, show
  the working in `direction.md`, and **never take the model's arithmetic** — its `headline` is a draft of the
  sentence, not a source for a number.
- **A figure carries its period and its unit**, on screen or in the scene's source line: *"Revenue, fiscal 2026
  (year to 25 Jan 2026): $215.9 billion"*. A company's fiscal year is not the calendar year; say whose year it is.
- **Round once, say how, and never toward a nicer story.** 215,938 (USD millions) is "$215.9 billion"; the growth
  computed from unrounded figures, then rounded. The same figure is rounded the same way in every scene.
- **The company's words stay the company's.** Guidance, outlook and risks are reported as the company's ("the company
  expects…", "the report lists…"), never stated as fact or extended. **No forecast of your own, no recommendation**
  — nothing that says to buy, sell or hold, no price target, no "good investment". This is an explanation of a
  document, not advice, and the end card says so.
- **The company's name in type is fine; its logo and marks are not**, unless supplied in `documents/`, and then placed
  as given. No real person — not the chief executive, not a face.
- **Honest charts** (Manual 13 is in front of you): bars start at zero; two figures compared share one scale; a
  chart's every bar is a found figure; no 3-D, no truncated axis. A single figure needs no chart — set it large.
- **A figure needs a comparison, and the document supplies it.** A number alone says little; beside the prior year
  or as a share of the total it says something. Use the comparisons the filing prints — a 10-K gives three years of
  results, so "how fast did it grow" can be three bars, not one. **Never an outside benchmark, an industry average or a
  scenario of your own**: those are figures the document does not contain, and they cannot be checked against it.
- **The chart follows the question.** Categories compared — bars. Change over time — bars by year, or a line once
  there are more than a few points. Parts of a whole — a stacked bar, or a pie only with fewer than six slices. One
  figure — no chart.
- **Colour means one thing for the whole film.** If the accent marks the answer in scene one, it marks the answer in
  every scene.
- **Never red and green for up and down — and a loss is never red.** Colour on a figure is not neutral. In eight
  experiments (1,451 people), showing US investors their losses in red rather than black cut their risk-taking by
  about 15–30% and lowered what they expected stocks to return. Blue and yellow did not do this, and colourblind
  people showed no effect (Bazley, Cronqvist & Mormann 2021, *Management Science* 67(9):5616–5641, §1, §5.1, §5.3). A
  red loss therefore steers the viewer, which an explanation that recommends nothing must not do. Which colour
  means a rise is also a market's convention, not a fact about colour: Western displays show a gain in green, while
  "in the Chinese stock market, red stands for a rise" (Zhang & Han 2014, *PLoS ONE* 9(2):e89193). Among Chinese
  participants red's effect on expected returns was not significant, about half the US estimate (Bazley et al., §5.2,
  Table 9). Elsewhere in East Asia the convention varies. A film made in one convention reads backwards in the other,
  and viewers who cannot tell red from green get neither. So **direction is carried by sign and shape**: "+46%" and
  "−20%" as printed, an arrow, a bar rising from zero, with a gain and a loss in the same text colour. Colour is kept
  for the answer, in the accent. If the brief asks for direction colours, use the audience's own convention, and
  record it in `direction.md` with the brief as its evidence.
- **Say what moved it, if the document does.** A large change the filing explains — a charge that cut a margin, a
  product transition — gets its reason in the company's words, attributed. Leaving it out makes the figure look
  better or worse than the filing does.

### Scenes

The film is **title → one scene per question → end card**:

1. **Title** (3–4 s): the company, the document, the period — *"NVIDIA · Form 10-K · fiscal 2026"* — and, if the
   answers share one headline, that headline in a line: the summary first, the scenes as its evidence.
2. **Each question** (8–12 s): the question first, in the audience's words, held long enough to read; then the
   answer — the figure arriving large, or bars growing (a `comp.rectangle` with one corner keyed — the three
   growing bars in the SDK reference's *Vector animation* section); then the headline sentence; then the **source line**: *"Form 10-K,
   p. 51"*, **a footnote** — about 22–24 px at 1080p, the muted ink at 4.5 : 1 or better, steady, in a corner of the frame the
   figure does not use. Readable when the viewer looks for it, never competing with the answer. **Give it `desc: 'source'`**
   (`comp.text({ …, desc: 'source line' })`): `Verify.film` then counts it as a citation, not grading it and not raising
   a stray when the watcher misreads its page, which it does at this size ("2026" as "2025"). The figures it cites are
   checked as themselves. **The source line is a claim too**: name the statement or table as the document titles it ("Revenue by
   End Market", not your question's "revenue by market platform") — the title is in the evidence, or ask for it — and
   never an Item number or section you did not read there. The page is `evidence.page`, the PDF's page; where the printed page number differs, give the printed one
   and say which in `direction.md`.
3. **End card** (4 s): the sources — the document and the pages used — and *"Figures from the company's filing. Not
   investment advice."*

**One scene per encoded part.** A 45-second film will not encode inside one script: encode each scene with
`comp.saveVideo('artifacts/part1.mp4', { from, to })` in a script of its own, then `Motion.joinVideos`, as stage 4
says. Plan the beats so every part boundary falls on a cut.

### Narration

**A voice when the brief asks for one (`Narration: Enabled`); silent when it says Disabled or says nothing.** A narrated report is read aloud to
the viewer, and the screen still carries every figure. Speak each scene's lines with `Assets.speak`, one line a call,
in the language of the film's words, and time the scene to the recording:

```javascript
const spoken = await Assets.speak('Revenue reached one hundred thirty point five billion dollars.', { voice: 'Charon', path: 'audio/q1-1.wav' });
if (!spoken.success) error(spoken.remedy);
const line = Motion.speech(spoken.text, { audio: spoken.path, start: 1.0 });
if (line.unsaid.length) error('the recording says more than the line: ' + line.unsaid.join(' '));
```

- **Each question's scene is as long as its narration**, plus the holds: the figure is on screen before it is spoken
  and stays after. About 140 words a minute, so a 45-second film is about 100 words: one or two short sentences a
  question. The question is on screen, so the voice need not read it out. Never cut a line to fit a beat; if the
  lines will not fit the length, lengthen the film and say so in Q1.
- **Say the figure on screen, as it is on screen.** "$130.5B" is spoken as "one hundred thirty point five billion
  dollars", not "about one hundred thirty billion". A voice that rounds differently, or names a figure the screen
  does not show, makes a second claim, and `Verify.film` reads the screen, not the voice, so the second claim goes
  unchecked.
- **The voice says nothing the filing does not.** No forecast, no opinion, no "strong" or "worrying": the headline
  sentence on screen, said in other words, and the page's own qualifications where the figure needs them. The source
  line and the end card are not read aloud.
- **The film must still work with the sound off.** Investors often watch muted in a feed: every figure and claim the
  voice gives is also on screen, in fewer words.
- **Encode the parts silent, and add the voice at the join**:
  `Motion.joinVideos([...], 'artifacts/final_a.mp4', { audio })`, as stage 4 says. Lines in the same voice are
  served from the cache for nothing, so give every line once, at the join.
- **Record the lines in scripts of their own, a few at a time**, never in a script that also encodes: recording
  counts against the script's time limit. Pass the lines to record in `ARGS`, and run the script again until every
  line is cached.
- With several audiences, **each film is voiced in the language of its words**, by a voice suited to its audience
  (*More than one audience* below), and figures are spoken the way they are written for that audience: "1305億ドル"
  is read in Japanese, not as a dollar figure in English.

### Visual style — produced, not plain

Exact is the floor, not the finish. The first report film was correct in every figure and looked like a slide deck: flat
bars on a flat ground. A generated video of the same brief looked like a produced piece — depth, light, a sense of
place — and invented a figure. **Do both: the polish, with every number still the checked one.** Decide the style
once, before the beats, and record it in `direction.md` with its reasons.

- **A ground with depth, not a flat fill.** A `comp.radialGradient` from a lighter centre to a darker edge (a vignette)
  under everything, and one slow move per scene — a push-in or a drift with `comp.camera()`, the ground and the
  chart on separate planes (groups with `z`, `keepSize: true`), eased `halt` at both ends. The move is ambient: small,
  slow, and **never while a figure is being read** — let it settle before the number arrives.
- **Light on the one thing that matters.** The scene's hero figure or bar gets a glow: a copy of it, blurred, under
  the sharp one (a group with `group.blur({ size })`, keyed up as it arrives and down to 0 after, which costs
  nothing). **One glow a scene**, on the answer — glow on everything is glow on nothing, and each blur costs about
  20 ms a frame.
- **Bars that are objects.** `radius` on the corners, a gradient fill (`comp.linearGradient` blended `onto` the bar,
  in a group with it) from the accent to a slightly lighter tint, a thin baseline. The other bars stay muted so
  the answer reads first. A bar still starts at zero and still shares its scale with what it is compared to.
- **Figures arrive whole.** A figure rises, fades or scales into place as the number it is — **never a counter that
  ticks up**, which puts every number between zero and the answer on screen, none of them in the document, and
  the read-back will rightly report them. **No character cascade on a figure either**: landing "$60.9B" a
  character at a time shows "$6", "$60" and "$60.9" on the way, numbers the document never printed. Animate a figure
  as one word (`basedOn: 'words'`) or as a whole.
- **Type as the design.** One family, the figures in a heavy weight and the units smaller and lighter beside them
  (*$215.9* large, *billion* small), the question above in a calmer weight, the source line a footnote. A
  scene's figures share a baseline or a column, so the eye compares them without hunting.
- **Cuts and wipes, not dissolves, between scenes.** A dissolve lays one scene's figures over the next one's — a
  frame where two sets of numbers are on screen at once, readable as neither. A `comp.wipe` or a cut keeps every
  frame one scene. **No motion blur on text**, ever: a blurred figure is an unreadable one.
- **Your palette, not the company's.** One accent and its tints on a dark or a light neutral; contrast still 4.5 : 1
  for text. Do not rebuild the company's brand identity — its signature colour as the whole palette, its typeface,
  its graphic devices — so the film reads as an explanation *of* the filing, not as the company's own
  communication. An accent that nods to the subject is fine; a film mistaken for investor relations is not.
- **The design board before motion, the books at the end.** The questions and figures are the document's, so there is
  no concept to choose; the look is yours. Draw the design board as the instructions say — a frame per answered
  question, the title among them — with `treatment.md` and `dos.md`, and hold the film to the board in Stage 5.
  `pitch.pdf` carries the treatment, the board and a frame of each finished film; `process.pdf` the questions and the
  figures with their pages.
- **Ambient detail stays in the background.** A few slow, low-contrast lines or dots (outlines at a low `amount`)
  can give the ground life; nothing ambient may move faster than the figures, or be bright enough to compete with
  them, and the flash check still applies.
- **Every movement has a job.** A move points at the answer, reveals the next figure or marks a change of scene; one
  that does none of those is noise in a film about numbers. One cohesive set of moves, eases and transitions, used the
  same way in every scene.
- **Budget the frame.** Polish costs per frame: time `comp.render(t)` on the busiest moment of each scene before
  encoding, and keep a scene's part inside its script — one glow and one gradient ground are cheap; five blurs at
  1080p are not.

### More than one audience

The instructions' *More than one audience* holds: every profile first, compared, `Taste.contrast` for a pair, one
`build(audience)` and the films `artifacts/final_a.mp4`, `final_b.mp4`… What a report adds is the rule that keeps a
set of films honest: **the facts are shared and only their writing is the audience's.**

- **One reading, every film.** Stage 1 reads the document once; every film answers the same questions with the same
  figures from the same pages. A film that drops or changes a figure for its audience is a different claim, not an
  adaptation.
- **Figures written as the audience writes them, in the language of the film's words.** `Locale.number(value, {
  locale, compact: 'long' })` returns the scale word: `13,049.7 crore` for an English film in Mumbai (`en-IN`), `1305億`
  for a Japanese film in Tokyo (`ja-JP`), `130,5 Milliarden` for a German one in Berlin. With `currency: 'USD'` the
  currency's own compact form is used whatever the length — `$13KCr`, `$1305億`, `130,5 Mrd. $` — which is terse in
  `en-IN`; where the long word reads better, keep `compact: 'long'` and set the currency sign in the words around it. Choose the
  locale from the place **and the language the film's words are in**: an English film for Tokyo writes `$130.5B`,
  since 億 inside English words reads as a foreign word. `Locale.locales` lists what is carried; for a place with no
  entry, keep the brief's language's own forms and say so. A counter takes the same `locale`, `compact` and `currency`
  in its `format`.
- **Never convert a currency.** A dollar figure stays in dollars in every film: converting it would be a new figure
  with a rate and a date the document does not give, and the read-back would find it on no page.
- **Tell the read-back how each written figure was written.** A figure in crore or 億 has digits the page does not
  print, so pass it in `computed` with its working: `{ computed: { '13,049.7 crore': '130,497,000,000 / 10,000,000
  = 13,049.7 (a crore is ten million; the page prints $130,497 million)' } }`.
- **Direction colours stay a rule** (above): sign and shape carry direction in every film. Only if the brief asks for
  direction colours does each film use its audience's convention, and only with a source for it (Zhang & Han 2014 for
  red as a rise in mainland China).
- **Pace and grade are each film's own**, from its profile, as the instructions say; the figures' holds follow the
  pace, and never drop below the reading time a figure needs.

### Pace

**With no place and age band in the brief, there is no Qloo profile to read**: pace from Manual 25 and the reading
time, and mark it *assumed* in `direction.md`. A figure is read slower than a word — hold a number at least a second
longer than its words would need. **With a place and an age band**, profile the audience for pace and grade
exactly as the instructions above say.

### The read-back — after delivery

The checks above measure the film; this one reads it the way a viewer does. **`Verify.film(comp, 'output.mp4', {
computed })`** is the instructions' read-back, and for a report it carries the most weight:
- **Every figure on screen must come back with a source.** For `document`, its digits are on a page of the filing,
  named with the page. For `computed`, pass each derived value with its working, exactly as set:
  `{ computed: { '+454%': '582.3 / 105.1 − 1 = 4.540', '$399.0M': '981.3 − 582.3' } }`. An `unsourced figure`
  comes off the screen.
- **A `'different figure'` stray is a line you set, read with another number.** It is exactly the error the report
  exists to prevent, so look at its frame before deciding. The watcher once read $974M as $744M with $974M plainly on
  the frame; and a figure caught mid-animation is a real fault.
- **A missed figure** was probably on screen too briefly for a watcher sampling about once a second: check its hold.
- The check records its own verdict, judged: a model read the film, and the sources and the ground truth were
  looked up. Do not write a verdict for it.

### Questions, for a report

- **Q1** (after the reading, before any design): each question with its proposed headline and its figures, each
  marked found, computed, or left out — and any question the document does not answer. The director confirms the
  facts before anything moves.
- **Q2** the tone and pace, with the length per scene.
- **Q3** and **Q4** as the instructions say: the design board, then the sheet.

### direction.md

The document (file, company, form, period, pages), **who read it** (`provenance.model`, `route`, and any fallback),
then **one section per question**: the question as asked, the headline, every figure with its page and the quote it
was found in, every computed value with its working, and anything left out and why. Then the shared system — type,
palette, the chart style — with its reasons. The read-back's result goes last.

**The audience gets a section of its own, before the questions**, so whoever watches the film can see why it looks
the way it does for these viewers. Say who is watching and where, as the brief has it. Then add one row per choice
made for them, in the `Choice | Evidence | Kind` table the instructions describe, with each kind kept apart:
- **Brief**: what the brief asked for.
- **Qloo**: the pace and grade, from a profile, when the brief gives a place and an age band.
- **Research**: a checked source, such as Bazley et al. and Zhang & Han for direction colours.
- **Rule**: this type's rules, such as no red and green for direction and figures arriving whole, and **the figures
  written in the audience's conventions**, with Unicode CLDR named as the evidence for the place's forms (`en-IN`:
  lakh and crore, Indian grouping).
- **Assumed**: anything decided without evidence, such as pace with no profile.

A choice the audience did not change says so — *"no red/green: a rule, whatever the place"* — so the reader can
tell a rule from a reading of these viewers. **With several audiences, one such section per audience**, then the
instructions' *Between the audiences*, which for a report says first what every film shares: the questions, the
figures and their pages.
