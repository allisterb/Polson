"""What a visitor can commission, in their words rather than the studio's.

The developer page offers `projects.WORKFLOWS` as it is: template names, types, and a brief box. A
person commissioning work does not think in templates. They want a film trailer or a poster, in some
sizes and some formats, made from some files — so this is the mapping from that request to the
workflow, type and brief the studio actually runs.

**Every choice here ends as text in `brief.md` or as an argument `projects.check` already validates.**
Nothing in this module selects a template by a visitor's string: a card names its workflows, a route
picks one of them by index into that closed list, and the type is checked against
`projects.WORKFLOWS` by the code that spawns the CLI. Sizes and formats are *asked for* in the brief,
not enforced — the workflows read the brief as prose, so a size the agent ignores is a size the
agent ignores, and the page must not promise more than that.
