"""*Why it looks like this*: a run's `direction.md`, read as choices and the evidence behind them.

The poster workflow writes one file, `direction.md`, in which every visual choice sits beside its evidence and
the kind of that evidence — Qloo, research, the brief, or an answer the agent assumed. That file is what a judge
of a taste-grounded poster needs, and as Markdown it is a wall of pipes. This reads its tables into rows the run
page can lay out, and links each `t5`-style reference to the Taste query the run actually made, so a Qloo line
shows the request behind it rather than asking to be taken on trust (design doc §4.6).

**The file is agent-written and therefore untrusted.** Nothing here interprets it beyond splitting tables: cells
come back as plain strings, and the page escapes them before it formats anything.
