"""The studio as a person commissioning work sees it.

The developer pages (`/`, `/runs/<id>`) show the machinery: projects, sessions, the record, the
sense-making curve. These show the same things in a client's terms — choose a workflow, say what you
want in which sizes and formats, attach the files to use, and watch it get made — styled by the Polson
Studio design system (`static/polson.css`).

**Nothing here is a second path to the agent.** A request becomes a project through `projects.create`,
which hands the brief to the CLI as a file; a run starts through `Registry.start`; a live request page
reads `/runs/<id>/events` and the artifact and deliverable routes the developer page already uses, with
their containment and allowlists unchanged. The one new file route, `/requests/<name>/thumb`, takes no
visitor path at all: it serves the newest image the project's own record says the engine rendered.

**One file is written beside a project, `request.json`**: the title and choices the person made, so the
request reads as "Harbour festival trailer" rather than as its directory name. It is display data only —
nothing the agent reads — and a project without one falls back to its id.
