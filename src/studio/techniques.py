"""The design techniques a request can ask for or rule out: the composer's "Graphic design" field.

**One catalogue, the CLI's.** `create-project --request/--deny` checks every id against
`ProjectTemplate/_shared/techniques.json`, and `polson techniques --json` prints it; the form reads that, once, rather
than a second copy here that could drift — the workflow table in `projects.py` has drifted twice already. A CLI that
cannot be run leaves the field out of the form, and the request is made without it.

**Three states, not two checkboxes.** Each technique is *the agent decides* (the default), *use* or *don't use*: one
radio group, so the two choices are exclusive by construction and the default is a state the visitor can see and return
to. A request means the agent uses it in the delivered piece, or in a concept and says why that concept lost; a denial
overrides the workflow's own defaults (the generator's `Techniques.Section` words both).

**What a visitor controls.** Only ids from this catalogue, for the request's workflow, reach the command line: the form's
values are matched against it here before anything is spawned, as `projects.check` matches the workflow and the type.
